Title : Studying Git & Github

Difference between Git and GitHub
- Git: where we track files; distributed version control system
- Tracks every change of every file to the file history → You can go back in time
- Can watch whatever you want b/c git doesn't look at files as text but as binary code (0's and 1's).
- GitHub: git provider; where you upload and share your git files & changes (history)
- Not the only cloud git provider; Bitbucket and GitLab exist.
- Has the highest market share among the three biggest providers
* Git projects exist inside GitHub




Commit: record; point in time
- When you make a commit, you're basically setting the record in your git
Initial commit: the one GitHub Desktop makes when it creates a git repo
* Good practice: say what you did in the commit message (title: mandatory, description: not mandatory)
After you commit, you have no uncommitted changes in the repo
▣ : green (new file) --> yellow (modified)
What people usually do: when they make a big major change, they want to save the pointing in the git history
